## Description of data files

We have generated 5 csv files and 5 different dataframe:

* [raw data](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/tree/main/raw%20data): The orginal data downloaded from moodle
* [wordcloud_IMA](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/blob/main/wordcloud_IMA.png): In order to select the best(most weighted) feastures from all features, we generate a wordcloud to help us to find the best suitable words from reviews. In our opinions, if consumers write "delievery is good" with 5 stars or write "delivery is bad" with 1 star in the review, it is clear that delievery is literally essential to decide the review is one-star or five-stars, which means that the word "delievery" is very important. We can calculate the frequency of occurrence of different words and generate a wordcloud to visualise the outcome.
* [brain map](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/blob/main/brain%20map.png): Mind map after discussion
* [Pre-processed data](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/tree/main/Pre-processed%20data): The preprocessed csv files 
* [Binary-Classification-result](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/blob/main/Binary%20Classification.png): The f1-score of every algorithm when doing binary classication(The samples have 2 labels: good(4* and 5*) and bad(below 4*))
* [3_Class-Classification-result](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/blob/main/3_Class%20Classification.png): The f1-score of every algorithm when doing 3_class classication(The samples have 3 labels: 5*, 4* and bad(below 4*))
