## Description of data files

We have generated 5 csv files and 5 different dataframe:

* [raw data](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/tree/main/raw%20data): the orginal data downloaded from moodle
* wordclound(): In order to select the best(most weighted) feastures from all features, we generate a wordcloud to help us to find the best suitable words from reviews. In our opinions, if consumers write "delievery is good" with 5 stars or write "delivery is bad" with 1 star in the review, it is clear that delievery is literally essential to decide the review is one-star or five-stars, which means that the word "delievery" is very important. We can calculate the frequency of occurrence of different words and generate a wordcloud to visualise the outcome.
* [Pre-processed data](https://github.com/Lynn-Luyp/MLDE-2022/tree/main/Pre-processed%20data): the preprocessed csv files
